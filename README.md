## React blog - Rest API

I followed a tutorial on how to create a full-stack app using React, Node.js and MongoDB.
In the end I created a open blog application where users can create post, edit, delete and read blogs.

> Disclaimer: Vercel won't let the images show, but you can see the back-end works. I didn't have time to put some images manually just for the look in VScode, will come later.

## Try these functions (CRUD)
----------------------------------------------------
- Register as a new User. (can have a dummy name and email, does not have to be yours)
- Login
- Edit user and profile picture when logged in.
- Write a new blog post, with image, title and text. (when logged in)
- View your posts and others.

(Passwords are hashed)


## Project Setup:
----------------------------------------------------
MERN stack
- Set up with create-react-app.
- Rest API with MongoDB
- Vercel deploy

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
